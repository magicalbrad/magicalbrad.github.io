## Welcome my corner of the GitHub Universe

I have several public pages from Github repositories, so I thought it made sense to have a main page. So, umm, here it is! Tadaa!

Maybe I'll do more with this page later, but for now, here's a link to some of my stuff. It's a rather ecclectic list.

### [Tic Tac Toe Printing](https://magicalbrad.github.io/tictactoe/)

There's a magic routine involving Tic Tac Toe. To perform it, you need to slice up and print out a graphic. This is a little utility to simplify that process.

### [OBS Mediastar](https://magicalbrad.github.io/obs-mediastar/)

During the viral apocalypse, I started doing virtual events, and wanted a way to control Open Broadcast Studio (a.k.a. OBS) with my remote control. This is a little utility adds a hotkey to do that. I use a remote specifically designed for professional entertainers, but any Powerpoint or ofhter remote that sends a keystroke would work.

### [Voice](https://magicalbrad.github.io/voice/)

OK, so this one is a bit weird. I perform a routie using a robot character. This utility reads out the script with a synthetic voice, and creates a JSON file to control the robot. I'm 100% certain the JSON file will be of use to noone but me, but there's a chance someone could use the voice part. It's basically an implementation of [Speech Sytnhysis Markup Language](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml)

### [Thundertix Google Analytics GA4](https://magicalbrad.github.io/thundertixGA4/)

When I find something I need to do that isn't yet well documented on the interwebs, I try to share what I learn for posterity. This is one of those times.

ThunderTix is a ticketing platform. Between Thundertix's lack of suport for GA4, and modern browser's cross-site cookie limitations, I found it surprisingly difficult to get GA4 working on a Thundertix iframe. This is documentation of what I finally got working.

### [Greater Cincinnati FCM Website](https://www.cincyfcm.org/)

This is the source for the website of an organization I am involved with. It's public to allow other members to have easy access. It won't be of use to most people, but it may be of some value of an example of a simple website built with the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
